# Record Search Tool — Implementation Spec

## Overview

An MCP tool that searches FamilySearch's historical record index for
a person. The caller passes clues — a name, a year, a place, the
name of a parent or spouse — and gets back a ranked list of records
that might describe that person, with the key facts on each record
(name, dates, places, family) and links the user can open.

Requires authentication (OAuth tokens obtained via the `login`
tool). Uses the lower-level FamilySearch search service at
`/service/search/hr/v2/personas`.

The tool is the **find** primitive of the genealogy toolkit. It
chains naturally with the other tools:

```
places(query: "Alabama")        // confirm which place is meant
  ↓
collections(query: "Alabama")   // find which collections cover it
  ↓
search({ surname, collectionId, ... })  // find a person inside
```

### Anchor rule (design note)

A search must include at least one of these anchor fields:

- `surname`
- `recordCountry`

A search with only `givenName`, only `collectionId`, only a place,
or only a kin name is rejected. The search service throttles
unanchored queries because they're expensive — anchoring on
something that meaningfully narrows the candidate pool keeps the
tool fast and useful.

## Input

Inputs are grouped by purpose. Every field is optional individually,
but the anchor rule above must be satisfied.

### Person fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `surname` | string | Family name. The strongest anchor for genealogy queries. |
| `givenName` | string | Given (first) name. |
| `surnameAlt` | string | Alternate family name (e.g., maiden name when also searching by married name). |
| `givenNameAlt` | string | Alternate given name. |
| `sex` | `"Male"` \| `"Female"` \| `"Unknown"` | Sex of the person. Case-insensitive — `"male"` is normalized to `"Male"`. |
| `surnameExact` | boolean | When `true`, only records with the exact surname spelling match. By default the search uses fuzzy matching (nicknames, spelling variants). When `surnameAlt` is also set, the strict-match toggle applies to both the primary and the alternate. |
| `givenNameExact` | boolean | Same idea for given name. Applies to `givenNameAlt` too when both are set. |

Setting `surnameAlt` or `givenNameAlt` performs a UNION — the result
set includes records that match the primary name AND records that
match the alternate name. Useful for women whose maiden and married
names are both worth searching. If just `surnameAlt` is populated
but not `givenNameAlt`, the MCP server code sets `givenNameAlt =
givenName` before sending. Similarly, if `givenNameAlt` is populated
but not `surnameAlt`, the code sets `surnameAlt = surname`.

### Life event fields

Each event group (birth, death, marriage, residence, any) has a
year range and a place, with corresponding `Exact` toggles.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `birthYearFrom` | number | Lower bound of birth-year range. Pair with `birthYearTo`. |
| `birthYearTo` | number | Upper bound of birth-year range. Pair with `birthYearFrom`. |
| `birthYearExact` | boolean | When `true`, the year range is matched exactly (no fuzz). |
| `birthPlace` | string | Birth place name. |
| `birthPlaceExact` | boolean | When `true`, the place is matched exactly (no expansion to parent jurisdictions). |
| `deathYearFrom` | number | Lower bound of death-year range. |
| `deathYearTo` | number | Upper bound of death-year range. |
| `deathYearExact` | boolean | Strict match on the death-year range. |
| `deathPlace` | string | Death place name. |
| `deathPlaceExact` | boolean | Strict match on the death place. |
| `marriageYearFrom` | number | Lower bound of marriage-year range. |
| `marriageYearTo` | number | Upper bound of marriage-year range. |
| `marriageYearExact` | boolean | Strict match on the marriage-year range. |
| `marriagePlace` | string | Marriage place name. |
| `marriagePlaceExact` | boolean | Strict match on the marriage place. |
| `residenceYearFrom` | number | Lower bound of residence-year range (census-style anchor). |
| `residenceYearTo` | number | Upper bound of residence-year range. |
| `residenceYearExact` | boolean | Strict match on the residence-year range. |
| `residencePlace` | string | Residence place name. |
| `residencePlaceExact` | boolean | Strict match on the residence place. |
| `anyYearFrom` | number | Lower bound of an event-year range that matches any event type (use when the event type is unknown or doesn't matter). |
| `anyYearTo` | number | Upper bound of any-event-year range. |
| `anyYearExact` | boolean | Strict match on the any-event-year range. |
| `anyPlace` | string | Place name for an event of any type. |
| `anyPlaceExact` | boolean | Strict match on the any-event place. |

Year inputs are 4-digit years. The search engine ignores month and
day even if supplied.

### Family member fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `spouseGivenName` | string | Spouse's given name. |
| `spouseSurname` | string | Spouse's family name. |
| `spouseGivenNameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the spouse's given name. |
| `spouseSurnameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the spouse's family name. |
| `fatherGivenName` | string | Father's given name. |
| `fatherSurname` | string | Father's family name. |
| `fatherGivenNameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the father's given name. |
| `fatherSurnameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the father's family name. |
| `motherGivenName` | string | Mother's given name. |
| `motherSurname` | string | Mother's family name. |
| `motherGivenNameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the mother's given name. |
| `motherSurnameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the mother's family name. |
| `parentGivenName` | string | Parent's given name when sex unknown. |
| `parentSurname` | string | Parent's family name when sex unknown. |
| `parentGivenNameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the parent's given name. |
| `parentSurnameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the parent's family name. |
| `otherGivenName` | string | A given name appearing alongside the searched person, of unknown relationship. |
| `otherSurname` | string | A family name appearing alongside the searched person, of unknown relationship. |
| `otherGivenNameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the other given name. |
| `otherSurnameExact` | boolean | Strict match on the other family name. |

`other*` is for cases where the caller knows two names appear
together in a record but doesn't know the formal relationship.

### Record-source fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `collectionId` | string | A FamilySearch collection ID — the `id` string returned by the `collections_search` tool (e.g., `"1743384"`). |
| `imageGroupNumber` | string | Image group number of a specific digitized volume (e.g., `"004010852"`). Also accepts split DGS format (e.g., `"004010852_001_M9QY-X6Y"`). Use the `image_search` tool first to find the image group number. |
| `recordCountry` | string | Country where the record was created (e.g., `"United States"`, `"England"`). |
| `recordSubdivision` | string | State or province within the country (e.g., `"Alabama"`). Requires `recordCountry`. |
| `recordType` | `"birth"` \| `"marriage"` \| `"death"` \| `"census"` \| `"immigration"` \| `"military"` \| `"probate"` \| `"other"` | Type of record. |
| `maritalStatus` | `"Married"` \| `"Single"` \| `"Divorced"` \| `"Widowed"` | Marital status. Case-sensitive. Many records leave this field blank, so filtering on it excludes records where the field is unfilled. |
| `isPrincipal` | boolean | Filters by the searched person's role inside each record. `true` returns only records where the matched person is the **principal subject** of the record (e.g., the bride or groom on a marriage certificate, the deceased on a death certificate, the child on a birth certificate). `false` returns only records where the matched person is named but is **not** the principal (e.g., listed as a parent on a child's birth certificate, as a spouse on a death certificate, as a witness on a marriage). When the parameter is **omitted**, both principal and non-principal mentions are returned (the broadest set). |

**What `isPrincipal` actually does (background for the LLM caller):**
Every FamilySearch persona record (one indexed row from one historical
document) has exactly one *principal* person — the main subject the
record is about — and zero or more *non-principal* people mentioned
alongside (parents on a birth record, witnesses on a marriage, surviving
relatives on a death record). The search engine matches the name query
against *any* person in *any* record — both principals and
non-principals. `isPrincipal` then filters that match set:

- `isPrincipal=true` → only records where the matched person is the
  main subject. Use when building a profile of the person directly:
  *"find John Smith's own birth, marriage, death records."*
- `isPrincipal=false` → only records where the matched person is
  mentioned but isn't the main subject. Use to discover collateral
  relatives: *"find records that name John Smith as a parent, spouse,
  or witness"* — the principals of the returned records will be his
  children, his spouse, etc.
- Omitted → both. The broadest set, ranked by match quality.

For most natural-language searches, omit the parameter — only set it
when the caller's intent specifically requires one role or the other.

### Pagination

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `count` | number | Results per call. Max 100. **Default 50 when `subjectId` is supplied, 20 otherwise.** The default is coupled to ranking on purpose: a deep pool is worth fetching only because the re-ranker cuts it back host-side. Fetching 50 without ranking hands the model 50 raw stubs to triage, which is the cost this default exists to avoid. |
| `offset` | number | Pagination offset. Default 0. The combined value `offset + count` must be at most 4999. |

### Examples

Specific person:
```json
{
  "surname": "Lincoln",
  "givenName": "Abraham",
  "birthYearFrom": 1809,
  "birthYearTo": 1809,
  "birthPlace": "Kentucky"
}
```

Marriage records in a specific collection:
```json
{
  "surname": "Smith",
  "givenName": "John",
  "collectionId": "1743384",
  "marriageYearFrom": 1850,
  "marriageYearTo": 1859,
  "isPrincipal": true
}
```

Maiden + married name (UNION):
```json
{
  "givenName": "Mary",
  "surname": "Lincoln",
  "surnameAlt": "Todd"
}
```

The tool auto-pairs alt names — supplying just `surnameAlt: "Todd"` is
enough; the tool fills `givenNameAlt = "Mary"` (copied from
`givenName`) before sending so the API receives a complete alternate-name
pair. Same in reverse if `givenNameAlt` is set without `surnameAlt`.
See *Alt-name handling* under *FamilySearch API Reference* for the
wire-level mechanics.

Country-scoped death-year range:
```json
{
  "surname": "Smith",
  "recordCountry": "United States",
  "recordType": "death",
  "deathYearFrom": 1900,
  "deathYearTo": 1920
}
```

Strict surname + birth-place match:
```json
{
  "surname": "Smyth",
  "surnameExact": true,
  "birthPlace": "Hodgenville, Kentucky",
  "birthPlaceExact": true
}
```

---

## Output

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `query` | object | Echo of the input fields the caller supplied. |
| `totalMatches` | number | Total records matching the query in the corpus. |
| `paginationCappedAt` | number | The hard limit on how many results are reachable through pagination (4999). When `totalMatches > paginationCappedAt`, the rest are unreachable — narrow the query. |
| `returned` | number | Number of results in this response (≤ `count`). |
| `offset` | number | Echo of the input offset (0 if not supplied). |
| `hasMore` | boolean | `true` when more pages are available (the response includes a `links.next`). |
| `rankingSkipped` | string \| undefined | Present **only** when `projectPath` was supplied and `subjectId` was not. Names the two features that therefore did not run, and how to get them. **Serialized before `results`** — see below. |
| `results` | RecordSearchResult[] | The ranked results, best-scoring first. |
| `jurisdictionHints` | object \| undefined | Present on a marriage search made with both `projectPath` and `subjectId`, when it either did not find the subject **or** found one but the tree knows a place these people were at or before the search's window. See below. |

### `rankingSkipped` — saying so when no subject was named

Host-side ranking (`ranked`) and `jurisdictionHints` are both gated on
`subjectId`. When it is absent both silently do nothing: no error, no note,
nothing in the response or the run log to say a feature was bypassed.

Measured `subjectId` coverage across the six graded `jimmie-jewel-neal` runs is
**59 of 171 `record_search` calls (34.5%)** — by run, in order: 0%, 0%, 0%, 100%,
55%, 39%. `search-records/SKILL.md` already carries four "pass `subjectId`"
instructions, and the tool's own schema says *"supply it for any search where you
know which tree person you are looking for, which is nearly all of them"*. So the
answer is not a fifth instruction: this is the same decay curve that motivated
folding ranking into `record_search` in the first place, and a field re-delivered
on every call is immune to the compaction that erodes prose.

**The condition is `projectPath` present and `subjectId` absent — and nothing
else.** No tree read, no name/date matching, no attempt to judge whether the
search "looked like" it was about a tree person. That test is a heuristic, and
gating the signal on an unvalidated heuristic would bias the very coverage
measurement the signal exists to produce. A caller running a legitimate broad
survey gets one extra short field; whether a given omission was legitimate is
answered at analysis time from the args already in the run log.

Falsiness, not `=== undefined`, is the test on `subjectId`, because the ranking
gate is itself `input.subjectId &&`. Matching it exactly is what stops the field
claiming ranking was skipped when it ran, or the reverse.

#### Key order

`rankingSkipped` is emitted **before `results`** in the response object. `results`
is by far the largest field, so anything serialized after it is the first thing any
size bound drops. The motivating evidence: across the 46 `record_search` calls in
`run-2026-07-31_13-02-13` the existing `ranked` **field** appears in the run log
**0 times**, though 18 of those calls supplied `subjectId` and **14 were actually
ranked** (the other 4 were nil searches, where staging returns `null` so the
`out.staged &&` half of the ranking gate never fires).

**The capture fix does not obviate this, though a first draft of this section
claimed it mostly did.** Key preservation only helps a capture that *has* keys. Of
the 1544 tool results in the six committed runs, **434 arrive as a plain string,
238 of them over the threshold** — for those `_summarize_response` applies only the
string bound, there is nothing to preserve, and position is fully decisive. A
further 11 hit `_RUNLOG_MAX_CHARS` and degrade to a head cut of the summary. So the
ordering matters for roughly 16% of captures, not the 0.7% that draft asserted.
`record_search` itself lands in the plain-string class whenever its response comes
back as the MCP over-limit error.

Two further consumers keep the ordering load-bearing regardless: the model's own
context window, and anything else that bounds this response without the harness's
key preservation. #1073's Definition of Done requires the ordering in any case.

The capture side was widened in the same change
(`eval/harness/e2e/orchestrator.py::_summarize_tool_response` now summarizes by
key rather than head-truncating at 497 chars). Both halves are kept: the response
is read by more than one consumer, and only one of them was fixed.

That capture carries a hard invariant — **it never emits a shorter capture than
the old head-truncation would have.** A response that already fit is passed
through verbatim, and where a key-preserving summary comes out shorter than a
497-char prefix would (a long list of small items) the longer of the two is kept.
Both halves are needed: an unconditional summarize narrowed 91 of 284 real tool
results, because `_summarize_response` samples any list past three entries.

**The invariant is a LENGTH floor, not a content guarantee, and content loss does
happen.** Two mechanisms can drop something the old head cut kept while the floor
still holds: `_summarize_response` samples any list past three entries, and its
depth cap replaces anything nested past 8 levels with a `_truncated_for_depth`
marker. A verified instance, in `run-2026-07-31_13-02-13` — a 3928-char response
whose old 500-char capture contained `"type":"Birth","date":"08 Nov 1919"` and
whose new 2165-char capture does not, because that fact was the 4th entry of a
7-entry list. So the honest claim is "never emits a *shorter* capture", full stop.
Do not extend it to "captures everything it used to"; an earlier version of this
section asserted zero content loss and was wrong.

**Size cost.** Captured response text grows **2.16x** across the 1544 tool results
in the six committed runs. `run-<ts>.json` is committed to git, so that is the
price of the change, stated rather than discovered later.

That 2.16x is the whole cost. `_summarize_tool_response` has exactly one caller —
`tool_calls[].response_summary`. It had a second until #1238, which rendered the
tool-call `args` into `run-<ts>.transcript.md`; #1238 removed both the transcript
and that call site, so no other artifact grows.

**`response_summary` now has two shapes.** Under the verbatim threshold it keeps
the raw MCP envelope, in which the tool's document is an escaped string; over it,
the document is unwrapped into real JSON keys. Consequences, and the reason
`docs/specs/e2e-test-spec.md` §15 ("Evidence to read, in order", step 4) carries a
matching caveat: **741 of the 1544 captures (48%) differ from what the old code
produced**, so the first run after this lands shows a changed `response_summary` on
half of all calls against every earlier baseline — which that spec's triage rule
would otherwise read as an agent regression. And grepping a *quoted* key misses the
escaped form, while grepping the bare name over-matches agent prose (`ranked`
appears 4 times in `run-2026-07-31_13-02-13` as narrative text and a `Grep`
pattern, against 0 occurrences of the actual field). Neither form is reliable
alone.

#### What this does not do

`rankingSkipped` is a nudge, not a structural anchor — it neither rejects the
call nor blocks a downstream step. Unit tests prove the field is emitted; **they
prove nothing about whether coverage rises.** The only signal for that is the
next live `make e2e-run TEST=jimmie-jewel-neal`, and the number to compare is
coverage %, not "the field appears".

### `jurisdictionHints` — where else to look after a marriage search

A marriage is filed where the wedding happened, not where the couple later
lived, and a couple usually married **before** they migrated. So a nil marriage
search in one jurisdiction is a prompt to try the couple's *earlier* places, not
a finding that no record exists — and a marriage search that **succeeds** in the
couple's later home has not established that the marriage it found was their
first, which is the only kind that carries a bride's birth surname.

The tool computes those places itself rather than relying on the caller to
remember the rule. This is the same reasoning as host-side ranking: a documented
step decays under compaction, a tool contract does not. Measured basis: across
four scored `jimmie-jewel-neal` benchmark runs, every marriage search stayed in
the family's later residence — the jurisdiction the tree's own marriage fact
named — while the answering record sat in the husband's birth state, a fact
already present in the same tree.

Fires when **all** of these hold: the search was marriage-scoped
(`recordType: "marriage"`, or any `marriagePlace` / `marriageYearFrom` /
`marriageYearTo`); the search was scoped to a place **narrower than a country**;
and both `projectPath` and `subjectId` were supplied —

**and then either of two disjoint reasons:**

**(a) The search did not find the subject.** `totalMatches` is 0, **or** ranking
reported `subjectResolvable: false`. Offers every candidate the tree yields.

**(b) The search was not judged to have missed the subject, and the tree holds a
placed fact for these people dated at or before `marriageYearFrom ??
marriageYearTo`, or undated.** Offers only those places. Requires a year window;
with none there is no proximity signal and only (a) can fire.

"Not judged to have missed" is deliberately weaker than "found the subject".
When staging or ranking did not run, `ranked` is absent and nothing was
established either way — the note claims only that the search returned records,
which is true in every case reaching (b). Undated places are included because
`rankKey` already ranks them above post-window ones, and excluding them would
mean a tree whose facts are all undated — the thin compiled trees this targets —
could never fire (b) at all.

Reason (b) exists because (a) alone made the hint go quiet at the exact moment
the trap springs. A marriage search aimed at the wrong jurisdiction still
*succeeds* there, and success switched the hint off. The measured case, from
`run-2026-07-31_13-02-13` — the only run built with the full (a) trigger — is a
groom-anchored search of Hill County, Texas for 1878-1884 that returned "James M
Neal and Mattie Landham" at `matchConfidence: 5`. Ranking resolved the subject,
the hint stayed silent, and the record naming the bride's birth surname is an
1875 marriage in Nevada County, Arkansas — the husband's birth state, already
present in the same tree. Across seven runs of that benchmark, `Sampson` (the
answer) appears in **0 of 236** searches and Arkansas is scoped for a marriage in
**0 of 30**.

The genealogy under (b), stated one-sided on purpose: a woman who married more
than once **may** appear on any record — including her own marriage records —
under a former husband's surname. So a bride's surname on a marriage record is
not by itself proof of her birth name, and records from earlier in her life are
the ones likelier to predate her marriages.

The stronger form — *a bride's surname is her birth name **only if** that
marriage was her first* — was drafted and is **false**. The `jimmie-jewel-neal`
fixture refutes it with its own answer record: the fixture states that `Wood`
came from a marriage predating the 1875 one, so 1875 was not her first, and she
is indexed on it under her birth surname anyway. A biconditional would also have
instructed an agent to distrust the single record that carries the answer. The
note must not assert it, and a test pins its absence.

Two further things the (b) note must carry, because a place alone cannot reach an
earlier marriage. The date window is sent upstream as a query constraint, so the
note names the year to start before — computed from the offered candidates, not
asserted. And the offered place may be a **county** while the record sits in a
neighbouring county of the same state, so the note says to try the containing
state as well. Its ordering is stated as closeness to the window and explicitly
**not** a ranking of likelihood: a childhood residence is a family locality, not
a wedding venue.

`<= windowStart` is deliberately **narrower** than the ranker's own top bucket,
which admits `year <= windowEnd` and gives in-window years a negative key so they
sort first. A place they were *during* this window is evidence about this
marriage, not evidence that an earlier one exists somewhere else. `<=` rather
than `<` so a fact dated exactly at the window's start counts, matching the
ranker's `windowStart - year >= 0` boundary.

**Reason (b) is not self-limiting, and that is deliberate.** Replayed against
`eval/tests/e2e/jimmie-jewel-neal/starting-tree.gedcomx.json`, it fires on **6 of
6** eligible searches with 3 candidates each. Any couple with dated birthplaces
has a pre-window place, so on the eligible path it is close to unconditional —
searching their earliest known place does not quiet it either. And `samePlace`
excludes only the place named on *this* call (the tool holds no cross-call
state), so an agent that follows a hint gets another one, possibly re-offering
somewhere it already searched. What is bounded is the hint's **size** — the
at-or-before subset, capped at 8 — and the no-window path. Frequency is the
point: the defect being fixed is that the feature almost never spoke.

The sub-country condition matters more than it sounds. A country-wide nil means
the record is not in that country's indexed collections, so naming counties inside
it is noise — and an unscoped search never missed anywhere at all, which makes the
not-found note's "did not find the subject in the place searched" simply untrue.
(Only reason (a) makes that claim; (b)'s note does not. The first half of the
reason — localities inside the search are noise — carries the gate on both.)
Both are the same situation and both are suppressed. Across the six committed `jimmie-jewel-neal`
runlogs, **9 of 26** marriage-scoped searches carried no place scope whatsoever, so
this is the common shape, not an edge case.

`subjectResolvable: false` is set by **two** branches of `rank-search-matches.ts`,
and the hint deliberately fires on both. One is a scoreable subject against a pool
that holds no match (a real negative). The other is a subject too thin to
discriminate — no dated or placed fact — where the scores are noise. Those two
need opposite responses from the caller *about the ranking*, but they want the same
response here, and the thin-subject case may be the more valuable of the two: in
genealogy you often cannot enrich the subject, because not knowing the missing
information is precisely why you are stuck. A spouse's places are exactly the
borrowed context that unsticks it. Distinguishing them later wants an explicit
field on `RankSearchMatchesResult`, not sniffing the `diagnostic` string.

### Trigger width: the history, and why (b) was added

A nil-**only** trigger was tried first and is too narrow: in one verification run
it fired once, at 121 of 180 minutes. Widening to
`nil || subjectResolvable === false` came next.

Every trigger needs `subjectId`, so a caller that omits it gets neither the hint
nor host-side ranking. Measured coverage across the six graded runs is **59 of
171 calls (34.5%)**: 0% / 0% / 0% / 100% / 55% / 39%. That bounds how often any of
them can fire. **Do not read a run with low coverage as evidence about width.**

Coverage was then attacked directly, with `rankingSkipped` as an in-band nudge.
**That did not work, and the result is worth keeping:** in
`run-2026-08-05_10-31-31` (untracked, ungraded) `rankingSkipped` fired on
**46 of 46** eligible calls and `subjectId` coverage came out at **19 of 65
(29.2%)** — below the 34.5% pooled baseline. Per-run baseline was 0/0/0/100/55/39,
so a single run cannot separate that from variance; what it does rule out is any
expectation that telling the model to pass `subjectId` will fix reachability.
**A fix that depends on the model supplying `subjectId` should not be attempted
again without new evidence.**

That left width as the only lever, and reason **(b)** is the answer to the
question this section previously left open. What settled it: on
`run-2026-07-31_13-02-13`, the only run built with the full (a) trigger, the
single eligible search *found its subject*, so (a) correctly stayed quiet — and
that search was the one search in seven runs that could have reached the answer.
Replayed over every `subjectId`-carrying, sub-country-scoped marriage search in
all seven runs, against the fixture's starting tree: **(a) alone fires on 4 of 6,
(a) or (b) fires on 6 of 6**, and all 6 offer the husband's birth state. The delta
is 2, and both are searches where ranking *succeeded* — the failure mode (a) is
blind to by construction.

Width is therefore no longer the open question. The open question is **ordering**:
on that fixture the top candidate is Blount, Alabama (1860), ranked above Yell,
Arkansas (1857) because it sits closer to the window, and there is one measured
precedent for a wrong top candidate costing nine searches to one — see the
ordering rationale on `marriageJurisdictionCandidates`. If a run comes back
having followed the top candidate and ignored the rest, that is the ordering
problem, not this trigger.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `searchedPlace` | string | Echo of the place actually searched: `marriagePlace` when given, otherwise `recordSubdivision` + `recordCountry` joined (see "Place matching"). Never absent — `isSubCountryPlace()` gates the hint and returns `false` for `undefined`, so the hint cannot exist without a place. |
| `candidates` | JurisdictionCandidate[] | Places these people are on record as having been, ordered by distance from the search's date window (see below). **On reason (a), every such place. On reason (b), only those dated at or before `marriageYearFrom ?? marriageYearTo`** — a place reached later says nothing about whether an earlier marriage exists, which is the only question (b) asks. **Capped at 8** — the tail of a distance-ordered list is its least useful part, and this lands in a response whose assembly elsewhere strips `gedcomx` and hoists `collectionTitle` for context economy. The jurisdiction already searched is excluded, including differently-spelled and **narrower** forms of it; a **broader** place is kept, since a wider search reaches the other localities inside it. |
| `earliestAtPlace` | number \| null | Minimum dated year across EVERY fact at that place, not just the one chosen to represent it. Reason (b) filters and reports on THIS, never on `earliestYear` — the representative fact is the one closest to the window, so a place attested both before and during the window keeps its in-window fact and a `<= windowStart` test on `earliestYear` drops the place entirely. `null` when the place has no dated fact. |
| `note` | string | Plain-language statement of the rule, so the reason travels with the data — including that these are places to look, never evidence. **Two variants, selected by which reason fired.** (a) opens by saying the subject was not found in the place searched. (b) must not say that, because it is false there. (b) instead says a marriage found where a couple later lived is not necessarily their earliest, and that a bride's surname **may** be a former husband's so it is not by itself proof of her birth name — the one-sided form only; see the correction above. (b) also names the date range to widen to, and says to try the containing state, because a place alone cannot reach an earlier marriage. |

Each `JurisdictionCandidate`: `place` (as written, `standard_place` preferred),
`earliestYear` (number \| null), `whose` (the `persons[].id` that contributed the
fact), `fromFact` (e.g. `Birth`, `Residence`, `Marriage`).

Both spouses contribute, which is the point: the decisive place is frequently
the *other* spouse's birthplace, which the subject's own facts never mention.

#### Ordering: distance from the marriage's date window, not earliest-first

With a `marriageYearFrom`/`marriageYearTo` window the candidates sort:

1. places dated at or before the window, **most recent first** — the last known
   location before a wedding is the best guess for where it happened
2. undated places
3. places dated **after** the window, last — they say nothing about the wedding

With no window in the arguments there is no proximity signal, and the ordering
falls back to earliest-first across the whole set.

**Earliest-first over the whole set was the original design and is wrong.** It
ranks by absolute age, so a place tied to a much later marriage can top the list
on nothing but a small birth year.

Verified harmful in `jimmie-jewel-neal` run `run-2026-07-30_23-05-46`. Under
earliest-first the order was South Carolina (1847, the subject's *third*
husband's birthplace), **Georgia (1855, the subject's own birthplace)**, Yell,
Arkansas (1857, the birthplace of the husband who mattered). The caller pivoted
to candidate #2: searches carrying a Georgia place argument went from **0 before
the hint fired to 12 after**, and the two wrong parents it then minted were found
in those Georgia records. A run of the same fixture *without* the hint
(`run-2026-07-30_14-32-18`) had correctly declined to name parents at all, so the
ordering did not merely fail to help — it converted a cautious run into an
over-claiming one.

Re-derive from the run rather than trusting a summary: count place arguments on
`record_search` **tool_use** entries only. An earlier reading of this same run
reported nine South Carolina searches; there were **zero**. That figure came from
matching the string anywhere in a transcript line, which also catches
`extraction_append`, `research_log_append` and subagent prompts describing census
people who merely *happened to be born* in South Carolina.

The current ordering demotes Georgia to #4, below the Yell, Arkansas entry that
holds the answer — i.e. it fixes the real failure path, not the one first
reported. Ranking is the load-bearing part of this feature: treat a change to it
as a behavioural change and re-verify against a live run, not unit tests alone.

#### Place matching

`searchedPlace` is the caller's `marriagePlace` when given, otherwise
`recordSubdivision` + `recordCountry` joined — the caller usually scopes a marriage
search with the latter pair, and reading only `marriagePlace` left the exclusion
inert on most real searches.

A country term alone does not count as a scoped place: `isSubCountryPlace()` gates
the hint, and it is exported from `marriage-jurisdictions.ts` rather than duplicated
here because `placeTokens` deliberately collapses the distinction it tests (its
empty-fallback makes a country-only place look like any other single-token place).

`isSubCountryPlace` returns `boolean` and is deliberately **not** a
`place is string` type predicate. The predicate is unsound in its negative branch —
`isSubCountryPlace("United States")` is `false` while the argument is plainly a
string — so it would let TypeScript narrow an `else` to `undefined`. Callers that
need the string narrowed test `!== undefined` themselves; that explicit check is
what makes `jurisdictionHints.searchedPlace` a sound required `string`.

**Known wart, recorded rather than fixed.** `isSubCountryPlace("Co., USA")` returns
`true`. `placeParts` strips `co` out of `co.` and leaves the bare `"."`, which
survives the empty-string filter and counts as a locality. The failure mode is
precisely the one this guard exists to prevent — a country-wide search reading as
scoped — so it is worth an eventual fix. It is left alone here because `placeParts`
also feeds `placeTokens` → `samePlace`, i.e. the jurisdiction **exclusion and
ordering** this spec flags as load-bearing and requiring a live run to re-verify,
and because no real caller produces that input (`marriagePlace` and
`recordSubdivision` always carry a name). Pinned by a `KNOWN WART` test in
`tests/utils/marriage-jurisdictions.test.ts` so a future change to `placeParts`
surfaces it.

It is compared to each candidate on comma-separated tokens, lowercased, with
`County`/`Co.` dropped and the country term dropped unless it is all that remains.
The match is **one-directional**: a candidate is excluded only when it is equal to
or **narrower** than what was searched. So `"Hill County, Texas"` excludes
`"Hill, Texas, United States"`, and searching `"Texas, United States"` excludes
every Texas place in the tree — but searching `"Yell County, Arkansas"` **keeps**
`"Arkansas, United States"`, because a statewide search is a different search that
reaches the other counties. Dropping a locality level when the narrow one comes back
empty is the highest-value broadening move available, so the bidirectional version
of this test deleted exactly the lead the feature exists to surface.

Exact string comparison was the original behaviour and let the jurisdiction just
searched reappear as its own alternative, because callers spell places the way
FamilySearch's search expects while the tree stores standardized forms.

**Advisory and best-effort.** A missing or malformed `tree.gedcomx.json`, an
unknown `subjectId`, or a spouse absent from `persons` all leave the field off
entirely — never an error. Ranking degrading must not take the search down with
it, and neither must this.

Implementation: `packages/engine/mcp-server/src/utils/marriage-jurisdictions.ts`.

Each `RecordSearchResult`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `recordId` | string | The record-persona ARK in canonical form (e.g., `"ark:/61903/1:1:6K9K-3HN9"`). Feed directly to `record_read`'s `recordId` input, the record-match tools' `id`, or `source_attachments`' `uris`. |
| `personName` | string \| undefined | The person's name as written on the source record. Undefined when the upstream record carries no display name and no fallback name form. |
| `score` | number \| undefined | Relevance score within this query. Higher means better-ranked. Use for sorting within a result set. Not comparable across different queries. |
| `confidence` | number \| undefined | A 1–5 confidence band on this result, where 5 is highest. Surface for transparency; rank with `score`. |
| `sex` | string \| undefined | `"Male"`, `"Female"`, or undefined. |
| `birthDate` | string \| undefined | Birth date as written on the record (e.g., `"12 February 1809"` or `"1809"`). |
| `birthPlace` | string \| undefined | Birth place as written. |
| `deathDate` | string \| undefined | Death date as written. |
| `deathPlace` | string \| undefined | Death place as written. |
| `events` | Event[] | All other extracted facts that aren't already surfaced as birth/death (residence, immigration, marriage, etc.). |
| `collectionId` | string \| undefined | The ID of the collection this record belongs to. Undefined when the upstream record carries no Collection-typed `sourceDescriptions[]` entry. |
| `collectionTitle` | string \| undefined | Human-readable collection name. Undefined under the same conditions as `collectionId`. |
| `collectionUrl` | string \| undefined | Link to the collection page on FamilySearch (a web page, not an ARK). Undefined under the same conditions as `collectionId`. |
| `recordTitle` | string \| undefined | Human-readable description of the source record. |
| `recordArk` | string \| undefined | The source record's ARK in canonical form (the `1:2:` entry, e.g. `"ark:/61903/1:2:HSJG-CLNF"`). Distinct from `recordId`, which is the `1:1:` persona ARK. |
| `treeMatches` | TreeMatch[] | Suggested matches between this record persona and existing FamilySearch Family Tree people. Sorted by `stars` descending. Empty array when the upstream entry has no `hints`. |
| `gedcomx` | SimplifiedGedcomX \| undefined | The matched persona's record converted from the entry's raw `content.gedcomx` to the simplified GedcomX format (via `toSimplified`, see `simplified-gedcomx-spec.md`). Carries the faithful record shape — names, facts, source descriptions — for downstream tools that need more than the flattened summary fields. Undefined when the entry has no `content.gedcomx`. |
| `primaryId` | string \| undefined | The `id` of the focus persona within `gedcomx.persons[]` (the person this result represents). Lets a downstream consumer pick the right person out of a multi-person record. Undefined when the represented persona carries no `id`. |

Output fields keep the `Date` naming because they hold the date as
written on the record — which can include month and day even though
inputs are year-only.

Each `Event`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `type` | string | The fact type as a short label (e.g., `"Birth"`, `"Residence"`, `"Marriage"`, `"Immigration"`). |
| `date` | string \| undefined | Date as written on the record. |
| `place` | string \| undefined | Place as written. |
| `value` | string \| undefined | Free-text value for non-event facts (e.g., `"US Citizen"` for a Nationality fact). |

Each `TreeMatch`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `treePersonId` | string | Bare Family Tree person ID this record may correspond to (e.g., `"GQWZ-GPX"`). The full tree-person ARK is `ark:/61903/4:1:<treePersonId>` if the caller needs to reconstruct it. |
| `stars` | number | Match confidence on a 0–5 scale, where 5 is highest. |

## Authentication

This tool requires a valid FamilySearch access token. It must call
`getValidToken()` from `src/auth/refresh.ts` — the single entry
point for all authenticated tools. Do not re-implement token
plumbing.

If the user is not authenticated, `getValidToken()` throws an
LLM-instruction error directing the user to call the `login`
tool. The tool handler should let this error propagate (same
try/catch pattern as other tools in `index.ts`).

---

## FamilySearch API Reference

**Endpoint (auth required):**

```
GET https://www.familysearch.org/service/search/hr/v2/personas
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
Accept: application/json
Accept-Language: en
User-Agent: <browser-like user agent string>
```

**Required headers:**

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — without it, the API returns
  401.
- `User-Agent: <browser-like string>` — without it, the WAF
  (FamilySearch's web firewall) returns 403. Use the same
  browser-style constant the `collections_search` tool uses.
- `Accept-Language: en` — without it, place names in some response
  fields can come back in the user's session locale.

**Default flags sent on every request:**

| Flag | Value | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|
| `m.queryRequireDefault` | `on` | Treats every `q.*` term as a required filter. Without this, most `q.*` terms only rerank the result list without narrowing it. |
| `m.defaultFacets` | `off` | Tells the server not to compute facet aggregations. The tool doesn't consume facet data; turning them off speeds up broad queries by up to 9×. |

|------------|---------------|
| `surname` | `q.surname` |
| `givenName` | `q.givenName` |
| `surnameAlt` | `q.surname.1` (with auto-pair: see Alt-name handling below) |
| `givenNameAlt` | `q.givenName.1` (with auto-pair) |
| `sex` | `q.sex` |
| `surnameExact=true` | `q.surname.exact=on` (and `q.surname.exact.1=on` if `surnameAlt` is set) |

| `isPrincipal` | `q.isPrincipal=true` or `=false` |
| `count` | `count` |
| `offset` | `offset` |

URL-encode each value with `encodeURIComponent`.

**Alt-name handling:**

The API requires `q.surname.1` and `q.givenName.1` to be paired
together (cardinality `.1` works as a pair under
`m.queryRequireDefault=on`). The tool fills the missing half
automatically before sending:

- If `surnameAlt` is set but `givenNameAlt` is not, the tool sets
  `givenNameAlt = givenName` before building the URL.
- If `givenNameAlt` is set but `surnameAlt` is not, the tool sets
  `surnameAlt = surname` before building the URL.

This is a server-side helper, not a caller obligation — the caller
can supply just one alt and the tool ensures the API receives a
correctly paired set.

**Modifier syntax:**

The API supports modifiers on `q.*` terms using a dot-separator
pattern: `q.<term>.<modifier>` and `q.<term>.<modifier>.<cardinality>`.

- `.exact=on` — strict matching instead of fuzzy. Used by the
  `*Exact` boolean inputs.
- `.from=YYYY` / `.to=YYYY` — date-range bounds on date terms. Used
  by the `*YearFrom` / `*YearTo` inputs.
- `.1` — alternate value for the term (cardinality). Used by
  `surnameAlt` / `givenNameAlt`.

Modifiers stack with cardinality. Example: `q.surname.exact.1=on`
applies exact matching to the alternate surname.

```

Some entries have multiple persons (e.g., census records list a
whole household). The mapping logic below picks the right person
for the entry.

---

## Mapping Logic

For each `entry` in `response.entries`:

1. **Find the persona this entry represents.** Take the entry's
   `id` (e.g., `"6K9K-3HN9"`) and find the person in
   `entry.content.gedcomx.persons[]` whose
   `identifiers["http://gedcomx.org/Persistent"][0]` ends in that
   ID. If no match, fall back to the first `principal: true`
   person. If still no match, skip the entry.

2. `recordId` ← the persona's Persistent ARK
   (`person.identifiers["http://gedcomx.org/Persistent"][0]`), normalized to
   canonical `ark:/61903/1:1:...` form. Falls back to constructing
   `ark:/61903/1:1:<entry.id>` when the represented person carries no
   Persistent identifier.

3. `personName` ← `person.display?.name`, falling back to
   `person.names[0].nameForms[0].fullText`.

4. `score` ← `entry.score`. `confidence` ← `entry.confidence`.

5. `sex` ← `person.display?.gender` if present (already `"Male"`
   or `"Female"`); otherwise the last path segment of
   `person.gender?.type`; otherwise undefined.

6. `birthDate` ← `person.display?.birthDate`, falling back to the
   `original` field of the `person.facts[]` entry whose `type`
   ends in `"/Birth"`. Same pattern for `birthPlace`, `deathDate`,
   `deathPlace`.

7. `events[]` ← every `person.facts[]` whose type isn't Birth or
   Death:
   - `type` ← last path segment of `fact.type`
   - `date` ← `fact.date?.original`
   - `place` ← `fact.place?.original`
   - `value` ← `fact.value`
   - Skip facts with none of date / place / value.

8. (The persona ARK is surfaced as `recordId`; see step 2. There is no
   separate URL field.)

9. **Collection fields** ← from the `sourceDescriptions[]` entry
   whose `resourceType` is `"http://gedcomx.org/Collection"`:
   - `collectionUrl` ← `sd.about`
   - `collectionId` ← parsed from the URL path
     (`/collections/{id}` → `id`)
   - `collectionTitle` ← `sd.titles[0].value`

10. **Record fields** ← from the next `sourceDescriptions[]` entry
    (typically `[1]`):
    - `recordTitle` ← `sd.titles[0].value`
    - `recordArk` ← `sd.identifiers["http://gedcomx.org/Persistent"][0]`,
      normalized to canonical `ark:/61903/...` form

    Both are undefined if the record-level entry is missing.

11. `treeMatches[]` ← `entry.hints?.map(h => ({
    treePersonId: <h.id with the "ark:/61903/4:1:" prefix stripped>,
    stars: h.stars }))`, sorted by `stars` descending. The
    extraction is "take everything after the last `:`" — e.g.,
    `"ark:/61903/4:1:GQWZ-GPX"` → `"GQWZ-GPX"`. Empty array when
    `hints` is absent.

12. `gedcomx` ← `entry.content.gedcomx` passed through `toSimplified()`
    (`src/utils/gedcomx-convert.ts`). The output conforms to
    `SimplifiedGedcomX` as defined in `simplified-gedcomx-spec.md`. Omitted
    when the entry has no `content.gedcomx`.

13. `primaryId` ← `person.id` (the persona resolved in step 1). It always
    matches one of `gedcomx.persons[].id`, since `toSimplified` preserves
    person ids. Omitted when that persona carries no `id`.

**Top-level fields:**

- `query` ← echo of input (only fields the caller supplied).
- `totalMatches` ← `response.results`.
- `paginationCappedAt` ← `4999` (constant).
- `returned` ← `entries.length`.
- `offset` ← `response.index ?? 0`.
- `hasMore` ← `response.links?.next?.href != null`.
- `results` ← the mapped `RecordSearchResult[]`.

## Error Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| No anchor field present | Throw: `"search needs at least one anchor: surname or recordCountry. Searches without an anchor are too expensive on the FamilySearch API."` |
| `count` outside `[1, 100]` | Throw: `"count must be between 1 and 100."` |
| `offset` negative | Throw: `"offset must be non-negative."` |
| `offset + count > 4999` | Throw: `"offset + count must be <= 4999 (FamilySearch search depth limit). Narrow the query instead of paging deeper."` |
| Year input not a 4-digit year | Throw: `"<field> must be a 4-digit year (e.g., 1809)."` |
| `<event>YearFrom` without `<event>YearTo` (or vice versa) | Throw: `"<event>YearFrom and <event>YearTo must be provided together."` |
| `<event>YearFrom > <event>YearTo` | Throw: `"<event>YearFrom must be <= <event>YearTo."` |
| `recordSubdivision` without `recordCountry` | Throw: `"recordSubdivision requires recordCountry."` |
| `sex` not in `{Male, Female, Unknown}` (case-insensitive) | Throw: `"sex must be 'Male', 'Female', or 'Unknown' (case-insensitive)."` |
| `maritalStatus` not in the four allowed values (case-sensitive) | Throw: `"maritalStatus must be exactly one of: 'Married', 'Single', 'Divorced', 'Widowed' (case-sensitive)."` |
| `recordType` not in the eight allowed values | Throw: `"recordType must be one of: birth, marriage, death, census, immigration, military, probate, other."` |
| Not authenticated | Let `getValidToken()` throw its LLM-instruction error. |
| API returns 401 | Throw: `"FamilySearch session not accepted; call the login tool to re-authenticate."` |
| API returns 403 | Throw: `"FamilySearch search blocked the request. The User-Agent header was rejected by the WAF — check that the MCP server is running an unmodified build."` |
| API returns 400 | Read response body as JSON, extract `body.errors[]`, join with `; `. Throw: `"FamilySearch search rejected the query: ${detail}."` Fall back to a generic message if the body isn't parseable. |
| API returns other non-OK status | Throw: `"FamilySearch search API error: ${status} ${statusText}"` |
| API returns 200 with empty `entries` | Return `{ ..., totalMatches: <upstream>, returned: 0, results: [], hasMore: false }`. |

## Caching

No caching. Search queries are query-specific and high-cardinality
— caching wouldn't pay off and would risk staleness when new
records are added.

API response types (`FSSearchResponse`, `FSSearchEntry`, `FSPerson`,
`FSDisplay`, `FSFact`, `FSSourceDescription`, `FSHint`) and tool I/O
types (`RecordSearchInput`, `RecordSearchResult`, `RecordSearchEvent`,
`TreeMatch`, `RecordSearchToolResponse`).

### `packages/engine/mcp-server/src/tools/record-search.ts`

- `recordSearchToolSchema` — MCP tool schema (the JSON above).
- `recordSearchTool(input)` — main entry point: validate, authenticate,
  fetch, map, return.
- `validateInput(input)` — anchor rule + per-field validation.
  Throws LLM-aimed errors.
- `applyAltNameAutoPair(input)` — fills the missing alt half
  (`givenNameAlt = givenName` if only `surnameAlt` is set; mirror
  for the inverse).
- `buildSearchUrl(input)` — query-parameter builder. Maps each
  input field to its `q.*` / `f.*` parameter, applies `.exact`
  modifiers, encodes values, applies the default `m.*` flags.
- `mapEntry(entry)` — `FSSearchEntry → RecordSearchResult` mapping (the
  11-step procedure above).
- `extractEvent(fact)` — `FSFact → RecordSearchEvent`.
- `findRepresentedPerson(entry)` — the persona-by-ark match used in
  step 1 of mapping.
- `parseUpstreamErrorBody(body)` — pull `errors[]` from a 400
  response body.

### `packages/engine/mcp-server/src/index.ts`

Register `recordSearchTool` following the existing tool pattern (import,
ListTools, CallTool — same as `place_search`, `collections_search`).

## Verification

### Automated

```bash
cd packages/engine/mcp-server && npm run build && npm test
```

### Manual Layer 1 (MCP Inspector)

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node build/index.js
```

- `search({ surname: "Lincoln", givenName: "Abraham", birthYearFrom: 1809, birthYearTo: 1809, birthPlace: "Kentucky" })` — top results should be Abraham-Lincoln-named records with `collectionId`, `collectionTitle`, and (for many) `treeMatches` populated.
- `search({ recordCountry: "United States", givenName: "John" })` — should succeed (recordCountry is an anchor).
- `search({ givenName: "John" })` — should fail with the anchor-rule error.
- `search({ surname: "Lincoln", count: 200 })` — should fail with the count-bound error.
- `search({ surname: "Lincoln", offset: 4998, count: 3 })` — should fail with the pagination-cap error (sum 5001).
- `record_search` without logging in — should return the auth error.

### Manual Layer 2 (Claude Code)

- *"Search FamilySearch for Abraham Lincoln, born 1809 in Kentucky."* — Claude calls `record_search` with a tight birth-year range, surfaces the top results.
- *"Find John Smith in Alabama marriage records from the 1830s."* — Claude chains `collections_search` then `record_search`, scoping by `collectionId` + `marriageYearFrom`/`marriageYearTo`.
- *"Look for Mary Todd Lincoln by both her names."* — Claude calls `record_search` with `surname: "Lincoln"` + `surnameAlt: "Todd"` (auto-pair fills `givenNameAlt`).
- *"Show me records that have a tree-person match suggested."* — Claude inspects `treeMatches` in returned results.

### Manual Layers 3 + 4 (Cowork via WSL2 + native Windows)

For anyone comparing this against `docs/specs/search-tool-spec.md`,
the headline changes:

1. **Endpoint switched** from `/platform/records/personas` to
   `/service/search/hr/v2/personas`. Reasons: 100× corpus,
   `f.collectionId` works, cleaner errors. Trade-off: leaner
   per-entry shape, browser-UA requirement.
2. **Anchor rule replaces "surname required"**: any of surname,
   collectionId, recordCountry, maritalStatus, year-range, or
   non-empty requireFields qualifies. Reflects the API contract
   (any q.* term required) plus the throttling concern (cheap
   anchors required).
3. **`collectionId` is a first-class input** (single value only,
   not array — multi-collection results aren't balanced).
4. **`requireFields` modifier input added**. Upgrades any
   `q.*` hint to a hard filter via `.require=on`.
5. **`recordCountry`, `maritalStatus`, `birthYearFrom/To` filter
   inputs added** (true narrowing filters from the search service's
   `f.*` family).
6. **`surnameAlt` / `givenNameAlt` inputs added** for alternate-name
   workflow (cardinality `.1` UNION semantics).
7. **`treeMatches` output field added** — surfaces FS's own
   tree-person match suggestions.
8. **`collectionId`, `collectionTitle`, `collectionUrl` outputs
   added/fixed** — derived from `sourceDescriptions[0]` (the
   collection entry), not the v1-mislabeled `/externalId/easy/` URL.
9. **`recordArk` output added** — the per-record source ark (`1:2:`),
   distinct from the persona ark (`recordId`, `1:1:`). Both in canonical
   `ark:/61903/...` form.
10. **`personaApiUrl` output dropped** — search service has no
    equivalent re-fetch URL. The persona ark itself is the
    persistent identifier.
11. **`birthDate`, `birthPlace`, `deathDate`, `deathPlace`
    surfaced as top-level RecordSearchResult fields** (previously buried
    in `events[]`). Sourced from `display{}` for normalization.
12. **Mapping logic uses `display{}` first**, falls back to
    `facts[]` only when fields are missing. Simpler and more
    reliable.
13. **Mapping finds the persona by ark suffix**, not by picking
    the first principal. Fixes the multi-principal records issue
    flagged in v1 review.
14. **Date inputs are year-only** — same finding as v1, here
    re-confirmed for the search service.
15. **No 204 handling needed in v1** of the tool (defensive code
    only) — search service never returns it in our probes.
16. **400 errors come from response body, not Warning header** —
    simpler error parser than v1 (no Warning-header regex).
17. **Pagination cap is `offset + count >= 5000`**, not v1's
    `offset >= 4999`.
18. **`Accept-Language: en` header** required to prevent locale
    leak in `display{}` strings.
19. **Browser User-Agent header** required (WAF) — same constant
    as `collections_search`.

Everything in this spec is grounded in evidence from probe scripts
under `packages/engine/mcp-server/dev/probe-svc-*.ts` (run April 30 – May 4,
2026, ~170 queries total).
