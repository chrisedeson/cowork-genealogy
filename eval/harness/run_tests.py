"""Harness CLI entry point per unit-test-spec.md and the user's CLI spec.

Selection modes (mutually exclusive except --tag, which repeats):
  --test <id>     Run a single test by ut_ id
  --skill <name>  Run every test under eval/tests/unit/<skill>/
  --tag <name>    Repeat to AND-filter; selects across the whole corpus

Exit codes:
  0  every selected test resolved to pass / partial / xfail
  1  the harness itself crashed, OR any test resolved to fail or xpass
  2  any test was aborted for a test-corpus reason
     (`not_runnable` — missing scenario, invalid test JSON, OR calling a tool
     that doesn't exist at all — Type 1 unmatched_tool_call)
  3  any test was aborted for an execution reason
     (max_turns / wall clock / tool calls / tokens / error)
  130  the run was interrupted with Ctrl-C (SIGINT). Completed tests are
     saved as a partial `scratch_<ts>.json` run log per skill; in-flight
     tests are terminated and discarded. Conventional 128 + SIGINT(2).

Note on unmatched tool calls (Phase 2):
  - Type 1 (tool doesn't exist): aborts with unmatched_tool_call (exit 2)
  - Type 2 (wrong args to existing tool): continues to judge (exit 1)
    The test gets fixture_not_found errors and the judge typically fails it
    on the Tool Arguments dimension.

No-args invocation prints help and exits 0.
--list-skills prints every skill directory with at least one runnable
test JSON and exits 0.
