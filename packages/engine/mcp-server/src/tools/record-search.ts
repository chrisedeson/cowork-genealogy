  // while the answering record sat in the husband's birth state, a fact already
  // present in the same tree. Computing the alternatives is date arithmetic over
  // places the tree already holds, so the tool does it instead of asking.
  //
  // Fires on TWO disjoint reasons, and the second is the one that matters here.
  //
  // (a) The search did not find the subject — either literally no hits, or hits
  // that ranking judged to hold no match (`subjectResolvable` false). The ranker
  // sets that in TWO branches — a scoreable subject against a pool with no match,
  // and a subject too thin to discriminate — and the hint fires on both
  // deliberately; see the spec's `subjectResolvable` paragraph. Nil-only was too
  // narrow: in one verification run it fired once, at 121 of 180 minutes.
  //
  // (b) The search DID find the subject, but the tree knows somewhere these
  // people were at or before this window. Gating only on (a) meant the hint went
  // quiet at the exact moment the trap springs, because a marriage search aimed
  // at the wrong jurisdiction still succeeds there. The measured case, from
  // `run-2026-07-31_13-02-13`: a groom-anchored search of Hill County, Texas for
  // 1878-1884 returned "James M Neal and Mattie Landham" at matchConfidence 5,
  // ranking resolved the subject, the hint stayed silent — and the record that
  // names the bride's birth surname is an 1875 marriage in Nevada County,
  // Arkansas, the husband's birth state, already in the same tree. Finding A
  // marriage is not finding the EARLIEST one, and only the earliest carries a
  // bride's birth surname (#1189).
  //
  // Also gated on the search having been scoped to something NARROWER THAN A
  // COUNTRY. Unscoped and country-wide are the same situation: every candidate
  // the tree can offer was already inside the search, so naming localities within
  // it is noise and the note's "in the place searched" would be false. Across the
  // six committed runlogs, 9 of 26 marriage-scoped searches carried no place
  // scope at all — latent only because all 9 also omitted `subjectId`.

      collectionId: { type: "string", description: "A single FamilySearch collection ID — the `id` string returned by the `collections_search` tool (e.g., `\"1743384\"`). Call `collections_search` first to find the right ID for a place or topic. Note: this is a different ID system from the `place_search` tool's IDs — pass a place *name* to `collections_search`, not a place ID." },
      imageGroupNumber: { type: "string", description: "Filter to a specific digitized volume by image group number (e.g., `'004010852'`). Also accepts split DGS format (e.g., `'004010852_001_M9QY-X6Y'`). Use the `image_search` tool first to find the image group number for a place and date range." },
      recordCountry: { type: "string", description: "Country where the record was created (e.g., `'United States'`, `'England'`). Acts as an anchor — at least one of `surname` or `recordCountry` must be supplied." },

Omit the parameter to return both — the broadest set, recommended for most natural-language searches." },

      subjectId: { type: "string", description: "A `persons[].id` from the project's tree.gedcomx.json (e.g. `\"I1\"`). Supply it together with `projectPath` and the tool ALSO ranks the results against that subject with FamilySearch's own matcher and returns them under `ranked` — match-scored, attachment-checked, best first. This replaces a separate `rank_search_matches` call. Supply it for any search where you know which tree person you are looking for, which is nearly all of them. Ranking never fails the search: on a ranking error you still get `results`, plus `rankingError`. Omit it only when the search is not about a specific tree person (a broad survey, or a person not yet in the tree)." },
      count: { type: "number", description: "Number of results per page. Max 100. Default 50 when `subjectId` is supplied — ranking cuts a deep pool back host-side, so fetching one is worth it — and 20 otherwise, since an unranked deep pool is just more stubs for you to read. Override only for a deliberate reason." },

      projectPath: { type: "string", description: "Absolute path to the active project directory. When supplied, the tool stages its raw results host-side and returns a `staged.resultsRef` handle. The inline results then come back as compact stubs — no per-result `gedcomx`, no `collectionUrl` (derive it from `collectionId`), no `treeMatches` key when there are none, and no per-row `collectionTitle`: those are hoisted into a single response-level `collections` map of `collectionId` → title. The full-fidelity rows live in the staged file, so a broad search can't overflow the context. Pass the `staged.resultsRef` to `rank_search_matches` to re-rank by match score, and to `research_log_append` as `stagedResultsRef` so the results are retained in the log sidecar without you re-serializing them (that also lets you omit `query` — the staged payload already carries it). Omit `projectPath` for an exploratory search you do not intend to log (results come back inline at full fidelity)." },
