/**
 * Candidate jurisdictions for a marriage search, derived from the tree.
 *
 * A marriage is filed where the wedding happened, not where the couple later
 * lived. So when a marriage search comes back empty in one place, the other
 * places these people are known to have been are worth trying.
 *
 * This function only computes and ranks the candidates; `record-search.ts`
 * decides when to offer them, and does so for two reasons — a search that did
 * not find the subject, and a search that DID but has at-or-before places it
 * never tried. See `jurisdictionHints` in `record-search-tool-spec-v2.md`.
 *
 * This exists because the alternative is asking the model to remember it on
 * every search, which it does not do: across four scored runs of the
 * `jimmie-jewel-neal` benchmark every marriage search stayed in the family's
 * later residence — the jurisdiction the tree's own marriage fact named — while
 * the answering record sat in the husband's birth state, a fact already present
 * in the same tree.
 *
 * ## Ordering, and why it is not "earliest first"
 *
 * The first version of this ranked candidates by absolute earliest year. That is
 * wrong, and measurably harmful: it ranked the subject's THIRD husband's 1847
 * birthplace above the relevant husband's 1857 one, because 1847 is simply
 * smaller. In the verification run the agent followed that top candidate — nine
 * searches scoped to it against one for the jurisdiction that mattered — and
 * ended up minting two wrong parents there. A run *without* this hint had
 * correctly declined to name parents at all, so the bad ordering turned a
 * cautious run into an over-claiming one.
 *
 * What actually discriminates is **distance from the marriage's own date
 * window**. The last place someone is known to have lived *before* a wedding is
 * a good guess for where they married; a place they were twenty years earlier,
 * or forty years later, is not. So:
 *
 *   1. places dated at or before the window, most recent first
 *   2. undated places
 *   3. places dated after the window — they say nothing about the wedding
 *
 * With no window in the search arguments there is no proximity signal, and the
 * function falls back to earliest-first over the whole set.

/**
 * True when `place` names something narrower than a whole country.
 *
 * The hint is gated on this. A search scoped to a country, or scoped to nothing
 * at all, is not a search that missed *somewhere* — every candidate the tree can
 * offer was already inside it, so naming localities within it is noise, and the
 * not-found note's "did not find the subject in the place searched" would be
 * false. (Only that note makes the claim; the found-records note does not. The
 * first half of the reason — naming localities already inside the search is
 * noise — is what carries the gate on both branches.)
 *
 * Exported rather than duplicating the country set into `record-search.ts`,
 * because `placeTokens` below deliberately collapses the distinction this
 * predicate needs: its empty-fallback makes a country-only place look like any
 * other single-token place.
 *
 * Deliberately `boolean` and NOT a `place is string` type predicate, though it
 * was written that way first. The predicate is unsound in its negative branch:
 * `isSubCountryPlace("United States")` is false while `place` is very much a
 * string, so TypeScript would narrow the `else` to `undefined` and hand the first
 * author who writes one a compiler-blessed lie. Callers that need the string
 * narrowed check `!== undefined` themselves, one token, no unsoundness.
