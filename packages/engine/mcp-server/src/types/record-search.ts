  // Why a per-call field rather than an instruction. `search-records/SKILL.md`
  // already carries four "pass `subjectId`" instructions and the parameter is
  // supplied on 59 of 171 calls across the six committed `jimmie-jewel-neal`

  // Present on a marriage search made with `projectPath` + `subjectId` and scoped
  // to something narrower than a country, for either of TWO reasons:
  //
  //   (a) it did not find the subject — no hits, or ranking reporting
  //       `subjectResolvable: false`. Carries every other jurisdiction these
  //       people are on record as having been, ordered by distance from the
  //       search's own marriage date window (NOT earliest-first; that ordering
  //       was measured harmful, see the spec). A marriage is filed where the
  //       wedding happened, not where the couple later lived, so a miss in one
  //       place is a prompt to try the others, not a finding.
  //
  //   (b) it was NOT judged to have missed the subject, and the tree holds a
  //       placed fact for these people dated at or before this search's window
  //       (or undated). Carries only those places — one dated after the window
  //       says nothing about whether an earlier marriage exists.
  //
  //       Deliberately weaker than "it found the subject": when staging or
  //       ranking did not run, `ranked` is absent and nothing established either
  //       way. The note only claims the search returned records, which is true
  //       in every case reaching this branch.
  //
  //       The genealogy is stated ONE-SIDED on purpose. A woman who married more
  //       than once MAY appear on any record — including her own marriage
  //       records — under a former husband's surname, so a bride's surname is
  //       not by itself proof of her birth name. The stronger "…her birth name
  //       only if that marriage was her first" is FALSE and must not be
  //       reintroduced: `jimmie-jewel-neal`'s answer record is a marriage the
  //       fixture states was not her first, on which she is indexed under her
  //       birth surname anyway. A test pins the absence of that wording.
  //
  // Requires a `marriageYearFrom`/`marriageYearTo` window for (b): with no
  // window there is no proximity signal and only (a) can fire. `note` says which
  // reason applied. Advisory only; nothing downstream depends on it.
